# Personal Website

A personal website for my digital presence on the internet.

To get set up running the site locally, clone this repo. Then, run the following to install the dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

To run the development site locally, run the following:

```shell
npm run dev
```

To update the site, run the following:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

This compiles everything to a static site on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/MoenMi/moenmi.github.io/tree/gh-pages) branch, which hosts the site.
